--------------------------------------------------------------

## Exploring Module

Exploring modules is a week of exploration on a topic where it is hard to find expert on.
I prepare the module by exploring the topic for 2-3 weeks before the workshop.
Then explore, help and guide with the participants while exploring with them.
The aim is always to do a GitHub review at the end with what was learn.

Example of topic I have in my to-do-list:
- Arduino BLE: Learn how to do communication between Arduino and your device (PC/Phone) and your Arduino.
- Etherum: Learn how to do Ehterum transationction from C# to use in Application.
- Lynx VR: Can we do augmented reality application with the Lynx? If yes what are the condition.
- Oculus Calibration: Is Oculus precise enough to be able to do measure applications for the market.
- PayPal API: Is it easy to use PayPal in application? If yes, is it easy enough for beginner in C#?
- Audio Spectrogram: Learn thow to use a spectrogram of sound to detect specfic sound.
- ...


# Refactoring

Something that I would love to do is to teach by refactoring my old projects.
I have 200-400 small projects on my harddrive on all the topic: Wifi, Rest, API, AR, VR, Bluetooth, Arduino Conneciton, Kinect...

The idea would be to spend 1-2 days coarching students that are self-teaching  C#/Unity in the same room.
And prepare an exercice for 1 day where, I teach and make praticing the participant  on what I learn in the past based on the refactored code.

Example:
- Scan a building with Zed-Mini or Hololens (Could use AR Phone)
- Make application display context based on Wifi detected around
- Use a coins counter wiht Arduino.
- Do wall projection game in Unity.
- ... 

--------------------------------------------

# Unity Teaching

I teached Unity for 1-6 months in the past. 
There are hundred of module of 2-5 days to learn.
But they have meaning just if you plan to study for at least 2 months Unity to work in the field.
So I will do the list just if required by someone.

# Own Hardware I could do workshop on:
- Kinect 360 & Kinect One
- Zed Mini
- Oculus 1, Quest 1-2
- Theta S
- Arduino and boxes of stuffs
- 3D Printer Ender
- CNC 3018-Pro 
- Laser Engraver 20w 400x400

## How Did I Do That ? H-DID-T

The concept of "How did I do that?" is to create a workshop on demande on an old project I did during R&D or hackathon/jam.
When ask, or by will, I will take a project I did:
- Zip it to keep it as it was
- Explore it to relearn how I did what I did
- Refresh it to a new version of Unity if possible
- Try to extract toolboxes of it
- Propose a clean version to explore with the student

They are hundred of project that could fit this format.  
Just ping me if you would like me to work on any of my project for a workshop with students or employees.
