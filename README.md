## Exploring Module

Exploring modules is a week of exploration on a topic where it is hard to find expert on.
I prepare the module by exploring the topic for 2-3 weeks before the workshop.
Then explore, help and guide with the participants while exploring with them.
The aim is always to do a GitHub review at the end with what was learn.

Example of topic I have in my to-do-list:
- Arduino BLE: Learn how to do communication between Arduino and your device (PC/Phone) and your Arduino.
- Etherum: Learn how to do Ehterum transationction from C# to use in Application.
- Lynx VR: Can we do augmented reality application with the Lynx? If yes what are the condition.
- Oculus Calibration: Is Oculus precise enough to be able to do measure applications for the market.
- PayPal API: Is it easy to use PayPal in application? If yes, is it easy enough for beginner in C#?
- Audio Spectrogram: Learn thow to use a spectrogram of sound to detect specfic sound.
- ...


# Refactoring

Something that I would love to do is to teach by refactoring my old projects.
I have 200-400 small projects on my harddrive on all the topic: Wifi, Rest, API, AR, VR, Bluetooth, Arduino Conneciton, Kinect...

The idea would be to spend 1-2 days coarching students that are self-teaching  C#/Unity in the same room.
And prepare an exercice for 1 day where, I teach and make praticing the participant  on what I learn in the past based on the refactored code.

Example:
- Scan a building with Zed-Mini or Hololens (Could use AR Phone)
- Make application display context based on Wifi detected around
- Use a coins counter wiht Arduino.
- Do wall projection game in Unity.
- ... 

--------------------------------------------

# Unity Teaching

I teached Unity for 1-6 months in the past. 
There are hundred of module of 2-5 days to learn.
But they have meaning just if you plan to study for at least 2 months Unity to work in the field.
So I will do the list just if required by someone.
