# Univers Infrastructures RÃ©seaux

- Utilize TCP, UDP, WebSockets, and MQTT protocols in Python, C#, and JavaScript.
  - Learn the appropriate network protocol for each scenario to optimize performance across different programming languages.
- Employ Mirror and Photon for networking in Unity3D using C#.
- Implement data compression techniques to package data efficiently for transmission over networks.
  - Revisit concepts such as bits, bytes, and megabits per second to understand how to effectively compress data while acknowledging the loss of precision.
  - Every bit is crucial, particularly in long-term applications.
  - For instance, transmitting 0.1 megabytes per second for 16,512 players in a game results in 47 terabytes per hour of data.
  - Consider the minimal overhead, such as the 3 bytes required for MIDI networking.
  - Explore the use of UART with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication.
