# Methods

Prepare with a high-level structure and a junior adjustment.
This workshop is required to start on Friday to be the most effective.
The goal is to evaluate the level of the students and their objectives after the workshop.
Based on this, the workshop is adjusted over the weekend to fit the participants' needs.

The workshop is designed in small modules of half a day to teach skills that are tested in the form of an individual challenge on Friday.
Workshops designed by Éloi Strée are always free and hosted on GitHub.

# Material

- GitHub repository with:
  - Per day: two small exercises, objectives, keywords, forwarding links, write-up on what we are learning.
  - Per week: the objective of learning skills of the week and the challenge at the end.
  - Code provided to start the exercises.

# Default Challenge

_The evaluation challenge can change depending on the students' level, the workshop schedule, and the center environment._

> Description: Create an interactive game or story using Scratch that includes elements learned throughout the week such as motion, control structures, variables, and messages.
