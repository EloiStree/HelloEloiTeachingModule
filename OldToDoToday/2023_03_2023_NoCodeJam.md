# Welcome to Hello No Code Jam XR wiki!
  
In this wiki you can find information about how to create an application under Unity3D for Quest 2 without having to use code.  
The concept is to learn about VR in general and learn to make an mixed reality application by drag and dropping object on a calibrated room.  
  
I hope you enjoy the ride.     
Feel free to give feed back.  
  
If you have any questions before of after the workshop.    
Feel free to submit it here:
