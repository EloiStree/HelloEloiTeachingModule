# Welcome to Hello No Code Jam XR wiki!
  
In this wiki you can find information about how to create an application under Unity3D for Quest 2 without having to use code.  
The concept is to learn about VR in general and learn to make an mixed reality application by drag and dropping object on a calibrated room.  
  
I hope you enjoy the ride.     
Feel free to give feed back.  
  
If you have any questions before of after the workshop.    
Feel free to submit it here:

# To do today
_Abat les Spaghettis ! Vive les boites à outils._  
"Le travail de groupe est un challenge extrême difficile. Mais étonnamment, importer et utiliser le code de dizaines de personnes depuis l'asset store est simple comme bonjour. Le but de la journée est d'apprendre à créer un unitypackage partagé à partir du package manager dans le but de créer des outils utilisables en groupe. Cela pour lutter contre le code spaghetti et simplifier le travail de groupe"

# Research , Development and Service
_You can produce game for the store but most of the industry is based on the r&d, advertising and industry service._
_To be able to make VR application for those fields, you need to overcome the hardware and API on your way._

## Mission AR VR: the 9-13th September
- The goal of the week is to train yourself to work on a technology you don't know about. 
- Choose a subject that you don't master at all but you want to experiment for the week.
- No need to finish the game. But it is required to prove that you tried to master the technology you are working on.
- Team from 2-5 people.
- The game must be AR or VR (Can be both)

## To do today
- [ ] Main: Work on the end of your project.
- [ ] Secondary: Think / Brainstorm about which hardware or API you want to use during the AR/VR Jam. To check what equipment will be reserved and bring to the formation.
- [ ] Learn that you can be a wizard with Unity and basically do almost anything.
- [ ] [Learn about what hardware are often linked to virtual reality](https://github.com/EloiStree/CodeAndQuestsEveryDay/issues/386)

[Electricity reminder](https://github.com/EloiStree/HelloRemoteFirework/wiki/ElectricityBasic)
# Formula
_6.240000.000000.000000 e-_
A = Amp = I = Intensity =  6.24 e- * 10^18 / second  
V = Volt   Generate Force to move e-   
J = Joules = Energy measure  
C = coulomb = the amount of excess charge  
Ω = R = Ohm = Resistance  
W = P = Watts = Light/Heat created by voltage and power  

## Formula
- R = V / I
- I = V / R
- W = V * I
- W = 4 J/S = 2 J/C * 2 C/S  
- C = 1 Farad / V  
- V = I * R
- I = V / R
- P =V^2/R

# To Do Today
- Info sur la nausée en réalité virtuelle  :[VRSickness](VRSickness)
- FAQ/Tour de table sur l'Oculus Quest
- Une bataille sans pitié          
- Utiliser GitHub Fork & Push
Si le WMR est arrivé:    
- Petit tour de son fonctionnement
- Démonstration avec le Backpack

## Puck Them All
Que la bataille commence !!!         
Utilisez la théorie pour vaincre vos adversaires par la pratique.     

Choisissez vos armes ici:
- [ ] Low FPS: Use low frame rate
- [ ] Acceleration: Use an accelerating movement
- [ ] Sea Sick: Move the horizon to make the user sea sick
- [ ] Vection Effect: Use objects moving around to imply a move in other users brains
- [ ] Yaw Rotation: Use the vertical axis to turn around
- [ ] Environment latency: Use latency in the environment to trick the brain
- [ ] Lateral Move: Use backward and lateral movement only to move around
- [ ] Loading Time: Set a random loading time in your game where camera is fixed
- [ ] Lateral Move: Use backward and lateral movement only to move around
- [ ] Look at that: Make the user camera look at something without free rotation
- [ ] G-Force: Make a game that would imply G-Force in real life
- [ ] Look at that: Make the user camera look at something without free rotation
- [ ] Side Look: Give the possibility to user to look sideways of the moving object
- ... List non exhaustive.
Bonus:    
- [ ] Use Beer: Offer a beer to your opponent to beat him easier
- [ ] Sleepy Target: Find a exhausted opponent to experiment your weapon
- [ ] Placebo: Explain before the user play your game that it bring motion sickness
- [ ] White World: Try to blind your user with a full white environment
- [ ] Flickering Death:  Try to kill your user using blinking effect.

Pour soumettre vos armes de destruction cognitive.      
Veuillez:     
- Forker le projet suivant: https://github.com/JamsCenter/2018_10_01_PukeThemAll
- Créer un dossier à votre nom: "Unity/Assets/Prenom_NOM/"
- Laisser le code vous guider sur la voix de la cruauté.


À Gagner:
- Le premier à me rendre extrêmement malade, ou vomitif, gagne un pack de bières
- Les 3 premiers à me rendre malade gagnent un cornet de pâtes
- A chaque implémentation d'une arme, vous avez le choix de sélectionner une victime dans la classe ^^. 

Que le code soit avec vous !        
Et soyez sans pitié ;).

## Game Design VR: Harware
In 5 years of virtual reality & augmented reality development. The sensors to track the body have immerge from crownfunding in all direction. In a time where trans-humanism has become an almost reality. What can we use on the field for our clients.

In group, try to identify what can we use to track the human body information and play with them in virtual reality:
https://github.com/JamsCenter/2018_10_09_GroupDesignVR

![Humanitarianism](Image/vh07fxe1zubrkrdtjn1a1yg0e640uz4v.gif)         

A. Fork the Group Design VR project      
B. Sync the project to the original project      
C. Find all hardware you can identify:       
__Kinect, Myo, TapWithUs, Leap Motion...__           
1. Find the name of it
2. Find some images and photos of it
3. Identify why we could use it 
4. Identify what part of the body it track or interact with.
5. Add complementary information to it.
6. Commit & Pull Request your research to the group project
7. Go add a score to the scoreboard in the room 
8. Go the step "C" 

To win:     
- Pack of 6 beers for the one with the most score.

## Let's map them all

## Atomic Package concept
[![](Image/k00h7i9gvuttdgk5p8t2kusdnrohj9os.jpg)](https://sourcemaking.com/antipatterns/spaghetti-code)         
_"The hardest part of programming is not to code. It is to not code !"_        
During the project, try to make a code that will be use by other and reused from project to project.    

## Scope & Deathline
[![](Image/ckte9zk7lnlv50cjgxf5k86h1k1c6cvn.jpg)](http://www.commitstrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Strip-Projet-urgent-pas-urgent-650-finalenglish.jpg)       
_"Finish a project is just the art of priority and not being greedy."_
Try not to be the heroes and to do everything in a day. Select some tasks you can fill in your sprint.
And try to do it. And let's your dream tasks in the "Nice to have" list.       
 
The most important part of a project is not to have something that could be cool.
But something nice that is ready to use in time.     


## The PI law

"What ever you estimated, it will take you at least 3.14 time more that you expected."
